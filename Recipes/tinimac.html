    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese (Get a block from the deli; it's harder, cheaper, and easier to shred than the softer packaged balls.)</li>
        <li>1 pound Colby Jack cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces sharp cheddar (yellow preferred)</li>
        <li>1 pound cavatappi pasta</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (12 oz.) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>fresh chopped parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Shred the blocks of cheese: 1 pound mozzarella cheese, 1 pound Colby Jack cheese, and 8 ounces sharp cheddar into a large mixing bowl, then toss together and transfer half to a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Cook 1 pound cavatappi pasta in salted water according to package directions for al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon coarse salt, and ½ teaspoon ground black pepper in a small prep bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 3 tablespoons salted butter in a skillet, then add half the seasoning mix and stir.</li>
        <li>Add 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour and immediately whisk and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, the butter/flour mixture should be bubbling.</li>
        <li>Add the 1 (12 oz.) can evaporated milk and whisk constantly. Once it begins to thicken and bubble in the middle of the pan, add 2 cups heavy cream, the remaining half of the seasoning, and 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard and whisk until thickened.</li>
        <li>Add half of the shredded cheese mixture to the skillet, a handful at a time, and stir until completely melted and thick.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the cheese sauce and stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Transfer half the pasta mixture to a 9x13-inch baking pan and layer with a third of the remaining cheese. Add the rest of the mac and cheese on top then finish with the rest of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, then broil for 1 to 2 minutes to give the mac and cheese a nice bubbly, golden brown top.</li>
    </ol>
